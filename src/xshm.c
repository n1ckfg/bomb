/* The MIT-SHM (Shared Memory) extension is pretty tricky to use.
   This file contains the common boiler-plate for creating a shared
   XImage structure, and for making sure that the shared memory segments
   get allocated and shut down cleanly.

   This code currently deals only with shared XImages, not with shared Pixmaps.
   It also doesn't use "completion events", but so far that doesn't seem to
   be a problem (and I'm not entirely clear on when they would actually be
   needed, anyway.)

   If you don't have man pages for this extension, see
   http://www.physik.uni-regensburg.de/~scs22156/sofie-0.2/mit-shm.html
   or in the R6 sources as "xc/doc/specs/Xext/mit-shm.ms", for example,
   ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/R6.4/xc/doc/specs/Xext/mit-shm.ms

   (This document seems not to ever remain available on the web in one place
   for very long; you can search for it by the title, "MIT-SHM -- The MIT
   Shared Memory Extension".)

   To monitor the system's shared memory segments, run "ipcs -m".
